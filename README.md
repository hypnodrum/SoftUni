# SoftUni
Some interesting Python tasks and my solutions during my education in Sofuni.

1. The first one is from matrixes and it represents my personal idea on the problem and its solution. 
My approach is totally different from the author's, which led to much shorter code because of the logic that I used.

2. The second one is about a "Food Orders App" and it represents my abillity to work with Classes and Objects.
